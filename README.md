# Frozen Lake

Hi! This is a short experiment on Reinforcement learning using the OpenAI gymnasium library. In this case, we will train an agent to find the shortest path to the goal in the Frozen Lake game. We will train the agent through the use of Q-learning.

Here is a short gif showing the animated results of our agent on evaluation:
