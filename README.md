# Frozen Lake

Hi! This is a short experiment on Reinforcement learning using the OpenAI gymnasium library. We're going to train an agent to find the shortest path to the goal in the Frozen Lake game using Q-learning. This project was completed as part of the Machine Learning II course for the Big Data Master's Degree program at Comillas ICAI University.

We've created a short animated gif showing the training process of our agent on evaluation:

And here's another one that showcases its performance on 100 evaluations:
